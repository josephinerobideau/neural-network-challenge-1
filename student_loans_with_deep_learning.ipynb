Describe the data you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.**\n","\n","First and foremost, the credit score is a pivotal factor in evaluating a student's ability to pay back loans. Other key information includes the student's academic status (years in school and time left before graduation), GPA, and major (indicative of their future career). These data points are instrumental in assessing the student's loan repayment capability and tenure.\n","\n","**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model use collaborative, content-based, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your filtering method.**\n","\n","Collaborative filtering is applicable based on user data, as it helps to make recommendations based on similar users. This can be applied to student loans.\n","Content-based filtering and context-based filtering are for content and context recommendations based on previous content/content-related data.\n","\n","**3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.**\n","\n","One real-world challenge would be the amount of data and the uniqueness of the data. This could be problematic because if the data is not significant enough for a wide array of students with varying needs, the recommendation would be biased and, therefore, be giving a very general recommendation that would not be an ideal fit for the student. For example, say the average student needs a loan for four years of university, has an 85 average in high school (relatively promising), and is majoring in Business (likely to make 60k/yr +). This person's recommendation should be very different than a student who has already done two years, has two years left, has a 3.0 GPA or less, and is a liberal arts major. Though both students could very well be capable of the same things and paying back the loan, the facts are that the second student's tuition will be less money, for less time, with potentially less promising grades for graduation and a less promising career than would be able to pay back the loan. Overall, this example shows us the importance of having well-rounded data capable of giving each student a unique recommendation that will fit their circumstances.\n","\n","The second challenge could be how often the model is trained and how it is being updated. As the average student demographics change, as there are more possibilities for the average student's need and more possibilities for unique needs (but not necessarily as expected), the recommendation model needs to have regular training and updates to ensure students are getting the most up to date and accurate recommendation they can get. Otherwise, the results could be similar to those of the having biased data, and therefore, getting a recommendation that is only somewhat reliable or as unique to the student as it should be."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
